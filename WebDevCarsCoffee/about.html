          <p>A self-directed, meticulous, and charming Front-end Developer/Designer. He earned a Software Developer certificate from The Tech Academy’s boot camp–worked with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, GitHub, MySQL, Python, and C# ASP.NET. He has an art-oriented eye for designing and transforming art into something functional and interactive, so his focus is UI/UX design and development. Sales, customer satisfaction, team management are other skills that he possesses outside of web dev, and he is eager to expand his palette of skills.
